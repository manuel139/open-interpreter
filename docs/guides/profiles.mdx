Profiles are a powerful way to customize your instance of Open Interpreter.

Profiles can be accessed with `interpreter --profiles`

Profiles can be set with `interpreter --profile name`

### Helpful fields

`interpreter.user_message_template` allows users to have their message wrapped in a template. This can be helpful steering a language model to a desired behaviour without needing the user to add extra context to their message.
`interpreter.always_apply_user_message_template` has all user messages to be wrapped in the template. If False, only the last User message will be wrapped.
`interpreter.code_output_template` wraps the output from the computer after code is run. This can help with nudging the language model to continue working or to explain outputs.
`interpreter.empty_code_output_template` is the message that is sent to the language model if code execution results in no output.
