## Experimental one-line installers

To try our experimental installers, open your Terminal with admin privileges [(click here to learn how)](https://chat.openai.com/share/66672c0f-0935-4c16-ac96-75c1afe14fe3), then paste the following commands:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/main/installers/oi-mac-installer.sh | bash
```

```powershell Windows
iex "& {$(irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/main/installers/oi-windows-installer.ps1)}"
```

```bash Linux
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KillianLucas/open-interpreter/main/installers/oi-linux-installer.sh | bash
```

</CodeGroup>

These installers will attempt to download Python, set up an environment, and install Open Interpreter for you.

## Installation from `pip`

If you already use Python, we recommend installing Open Interpreter via `pip`:

```bash
pip install open-interpreter
```

<Info>
  **Note:** You'll need Python
  [3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/) or
  [3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/). Run `python
  --version` to check yours.
</Info>

## Install optional dependencies from `pip`

Open Interpreter has optional dependencies for different capabilities. The options are:

[Local Mode](/guides/running-locally) dependencies

```bash
pip install open-interpreter[local]
```

[OS Mode](/guides/os-mode) dependencies

```bash
pip install open-interpreter[os]
```

[Safe Mode](/safety/safe-mode) dependencies

```bash
pip install open-interpreter[safe]
```

## No Installation

If configuring your computer environment is challenging, you can press the `,` key on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/OpenInterpreter/open-interpreter) to create a codespace. After a moment, you'll receive a cloud virtual machine environment pre-installed with open-interpreter. You can then start interacting with it directly and freely confirm its execution of system commands without worrying about damaging the system.

## Terminal usage

After installation, you can start an interactive chat in your terminal by running:

```bash
interpreter
```

## Python usage

To start an interactive chat in Python, run the following:

```python
from interpreter import interpreter

interpreter.chat()
```

You can also pass messages to `interpreter` programmatically:

```python
interpreter.chat("Get the last 5 BBC news headlines.")
```
